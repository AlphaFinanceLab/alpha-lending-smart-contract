Alpha Lending is a decentralized pool-based lending protocol built on Binance Smart Chain. Users can earn interest on their digital assets (assets) by supplying supported assets into the protocol. We call these users lenders. Assets deposited by lenders will be transferred into a smart contract that aggregates total liquidity of each asset into a pooled fund, which is available for borrowers to borrow. Loans are not matched individually between lenders and borrowers, but are taken from the pooled fund. Interest lenders earn come from interest that borrowers pay, distributed proportionately to the liquidity they provide.

Once lenders supply assets into the protocol, these assets act as collateral, enabling lenders to also borrow any asset up to a certain limit. This means that any borrower has to first supply assets into the protocol as collateral before taking out any loan.
